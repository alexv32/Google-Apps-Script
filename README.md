Scripts made to ease the work done in google sheets for shift management


Shift management can be an uncoftobale task when working outside any management tool.
Especially when you want to track shift changes and work closely with Google Calendar to ease the tracking capability for your workers.

The sheet is build in that manner:
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Email</th>
    <th>Day of month 1</th>
    <th>Until the last day of month</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Worker 1</td>
    <td>Email 1</td>
    <td>Shift Type</td>
    <td>Shift Type</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Worker 2</td>
    <td>Email 2</td>
    <td>Shift Type</td>
    <td>Shift Type</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Worker 3</td>
    <td>Email 3</td>
    <td>Shift Type</td>
    <td>Shift Type</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Worker 4</td>
    <td>Email 4</td>
    <td>Shift Type</td>
    <td>Shift Type</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The point of those scripts are to set for each person the option to sync his calendar with the shifts for each day of the month and to be able to resync any changes made.

**The Script only works when working with Google sheets and with the same table structure.
